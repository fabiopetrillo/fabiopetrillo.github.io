I'm an associate professor in the Department of Computer Sciences and Mathematics (DIM) at Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (Canada) since 2018. My main goal is to create theories and techniques to **improve software engineers' life**.  

In my research career, I have worked on **Empirical Software Engineering, Software Quality, Debugging, Service-Oriented Architecture, Cloud Computing, and Agile Methods**. I have been recognized as a pioneer and an international reference on **Software Engineering for Computer Games**. I'm the creator of **Swarm Debugging**, a new collaborative approach to support debugging activities.
