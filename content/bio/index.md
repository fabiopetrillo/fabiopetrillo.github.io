I'm an associate professor in the Software and Information Technology Engineering Department at École de Technologie Supérieure (Canada) since 2022. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science in 2016 from Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil) and I were a postdoctoral fellow at Concordia University (Canada).  

In my research career, I have worked on **Empirical Software Engineering, Software Quality, Debugging, Service-Oriented Architecture, Cloud Computing, and Agile Methods**. I have been recognized as a pioneer and an international reference on **Software Engineering for Computer Games**. I'm the creator of **Swarm Debugging**, a new collaborative approach to support debugging activities. 

I published several papers in international conferences and journals, including TSE, EMSE, JSS, IST, IEEE Software, QRS, ICPC, SAC, ICSOC, and VISSOFT. He has served on the program committees of several international conferences including QRS, CHI, SIGCSE, ICPC, VISSOFT, GAS and has reviewed for top international journals such as TSE, TOSEM, JSS, EMSE and IST.
